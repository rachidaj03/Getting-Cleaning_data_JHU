# Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
The Getting-Cleaning_data_JHU repository is a Rachid AIT JALLOUL submission for the peer assignment project for the JHU Online Course.
It has some instructions to follow in order to run the things correctly.
## Dataset is being downloaded from here as I used the data unzipped because it is automatically unzipped on mac_os:
[Dataset of the samsung galaxy device](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
## Files are as follow :
- README.MD / The file you are reading right now which shows how to run the code
- CodeBook.MD / This file contains a description of the variables which will be used in the R console or RStudio
- Run_analysis.R / The code file which needs to be placed inside the dataset file in order to work, if you are working from an zipped file make sure to add some lines to
automatically unzipping the file and add before any directory the name of the main directory because to alleviate the tasks I have worked inside the file to make sure not 
to burn my hand with code writing and I hope you'll do the same
